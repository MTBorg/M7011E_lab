| 2019-11-06  | 3     | Deciding on general architecture of the project, we chose to setup the project using Docker. Also decided on using GraphQL for the API. Spent some time setting up the Github project aswell, fixed a project board etc. Also made issues for the simulator.                              |
| 2019-11-11  | 5     | Devided work between us, I'm working on the wind speed part of the simulator. Read up on Gaussian distribution and implemented a simple model which calculates current wind speed.                                                                                                        |
| 2019-11-14  | 3     | Noticed some problems with the wind speed model. Updated it to "better" reflect actual wind speed behaviour. Implemented a basic wind turbine power output model. Discussed the simulator and concluded that we need a database.                                                          |
| 2019-11-18  | 3.5   | Created a working docker image for a database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2019-11-19  | 7     | Itegrated the database in the GraphQL queries using join-monster npm package. Also wrote queries for current wind speed which uses the mean day wind speed from the database.                                                                                                             |
| 2019-11-20  | 5.5   | Implemented a battery. Added batteries to the db which stores the power and max capacity. And extended prosumers to be able to own a battery. Implemented basic functionality for creating new batteries and charging them with a specified amount.                                       |
| 2019-11-21  | 3     | Continued working on the battery implementation by adding a function for using the power stored in the battery. Also had some problems with async queries since I needed the query result to calculate the power which was used from the battery (if amount is greater than stored power) |
| 2019-11-25  | 2     | Fixed minor bugs. Started integrating the batteries in the continous simulation by adding a new battery to each prosumer at the start of the simulation but encounterd some weird bug.                                                                                                    |
| 2019-11-25  | 2.5   | Decided to initilize the prosumers etc. from a sql script instead of in the simulation. The batteries can now be used in the simulation but missing some features such as redirecting some of the excess power to the power plants battery.                                               |
| 2019-11-25  | 0.5   | Tested some branches before merging. Added two ratios to prosumers in the database, one for excess production and one for deficit.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2019-11-26  | 2.5   | Added the ratio logic for when to buy/sell to the market when production and consumption differences occur.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2019-11-26  | 1     | Did some general testing on master branch to assure everything still works. Found a bug and fixed it. Started on the query for selling power to the market.                                                                                                                               |
| 2019-11-26  | 1.25  | Trying to solve issue with getting amount of power sold/bought as a result from the query.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2019-11-27  | 2     | Solved the above issue, the query always worked but returned the result as wrongly spelled variable...                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2019-11-27  | 1     | Solved an issue with our eslint config not working for me in VSCode                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2019-11-27  | 2     | Wrote tests for market and ratios                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2019-11-28  | 3     | Wrote test for the power output of the wind turbine. Discussed with Martin about what we had left on the simulation before our meeting. Updated GraphQL schema to include prosumer batteries aswell as ratios. Also made it possible to change prosumers ratios.                          |
| 2019-11-28  | 3     | Wrote more tests                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2019 -11-29 | 3     | Working on blackouts, problems with determining if prosumer were able to cover up deficit from market.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
