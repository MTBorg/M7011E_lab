| 2019-11-06 | 3     | Deciding on general architecture of the project, we chose to setup the project using Docker. Also decided on using GraphQL for the API. Spent some time setting up the Github project aswell, fixed a project board etc. Also made issues for the simulator. |
| 2019-11-11 | 5     | Devided work between us, I'm working on the wind speed part of the simulator. Read up on Gaussian distribution and implemented a simple model which calculates current wind speed.                                                                           |
